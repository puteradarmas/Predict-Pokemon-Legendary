# Predict-Pokemon-Legendary
Pokemon is almost everyone beloved franchise, Pokemon franchise already live more than 20 years and becoming something that everyone atleast already heard about it. Legendary Pokemon is a Pokemon that we can say unique, its only can obtainable once and on certain event or very low probability to encounter. Pokemon legendary usually portrayed as big strong Pokemon but some of them actually small and have avarage stats. In this repository I try to make a model that predict if a Pokemon is legendary or not using skicit-learn.

## About the code
The code is written on Jupyter Notebook. The data is imported from CSV file that I got from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon). The code involve from importing data, inspect it, data manipulation, scatter and heatmap plotting. After that using several skicit-learn libraries to make the model by training it and then measure it.
