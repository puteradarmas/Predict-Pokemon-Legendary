# Predict-Pokemon-Legendary

## Background
In this repository I try to make a model that predict if a Pokemon is legendary or not using skicit-learn. Pokemon is almost everyone beloved franchise, Pokemon franchise already live more than 20 years and becoming something that everyone atleast already heard about it. Legendary Pokemon is a Pokemon that we can say unique, its only can obtainable once and on certain event or very low probability to encounter. Pokemon legendary usually portrayed as big strong Pokemon but some of them actually small and have average stats.


## Task and Learning Oppurtunities
In this project I required to know how to Exploring my data and manipulating it, preparing it. Build the proper model and measure it. Starting from dataset that I get from Kaggle.

see: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon

## About the code
The code is written on Jupyter Notebook. The data is imported from CSV file that I got. The code involve from importing data, inspect it, data manipulation, scatter and heatmap plotting. After that using several skicit-learn libraries to make the model by training it and then measure it.

### Modules
- Pandas
- Numpy
- sklearn
- seaborn
- Matplotlib

### What to improve
The way how I impute the missing values still have so many flaws. Especially when we talk about this data that have large varieties of values. Filling NaN values with Linear Regression might be a solution.

This project data visualization still far from perfect. Some data are hard to see so many people might have problem with interpreting the plot.

The code is somewhat dirty and hard to read. Simplify and using available function might be a solution. The model can be improved and use pipleine to make it easier to read and write.
